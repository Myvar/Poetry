Falling into the dark
into the vacuum grace
the silence of space
 
slowly
watching the body in the void
grow in face
 
watching the dark grow and die, grow and die
for i am falling into the well
into the light
many sunrises in one night
 
the acutely minded does not fear the dying of the light
for curiosity is light
 
and light is life
